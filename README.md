Description
===========

This is a Python library to use the GATT Protocol for Bluetooth LE
devices. It is a wrapper around the implementation used by gatttool in
bluez package. It does not call other binaries to do its job :)


Installation
============

There are many ways of installing this library: using Python Pip,
using the Debian package, or manually compiling it.

Python pip
----------

First, you need to install the depends. In Debian/Ubuntu this will be something like:

    sudo apt install pkg-config libboost-python-dev libboost-thread-dev libbluetooth-dev libglib2.0-dev python3-dev

Now, install as ever:

    pip install gattlib

Debian way
----------

There is a single Debian package available from
[https://github.com/oscaracena/pygattlib/releases](https://github.com/oscaracena/pygattlib/releases). Just download it and install using the following command:

    sudo apt install ./python3-gattlib*.deb

Compiling from source
---------------------

You should install the needed packages, which are described on `DEPENDS`
file. Take special care about versions: libbluetooth-dev should be
4.101 or greater. Then, just type:

    ./setup.py install --user


Usage
=====

This library provides two ways of work: sync and async. The Bluetooth
LE GATT protocol is asynchronous, so, when you need to read some
value, you make a petition, and wait for response. From the
perspective of the programmer, when you call a read method, you need
to pass it a callback object, and it will return inmediatly. The
response will be "injected" on that callback object.

This Python library allows you to call using a callback object
(async), or without it (sync). If you does not provide a callback
(working sync.), the library internally will create one, and will wait
until a response arrives, or a timeout expires. Then, the call will
return with the received data.


Discovering devices
-------------------

To discover BLE devices, use the `DiscoveryService` provided. You need
to create an instance of it, indicating the Bluetooth device you want
to use. Then call the method `discover`, with a timeout. It will
return a dictionary with the address and name of all devices that
responded the discovery.

**Note**: it is very likely that you will need admin permissions to do
a discovery, so run this script using `sudo` (or something similar).

As example:

```python
from gattlib import DiscoveryService

service = DiscoveryService("hci0")
devices = service.discover(2)

for address, name in devices.items():
    print("name: {}, address: {}".format(name, address))
```


Reading data
------------

First of all, you need to create a GATTRequester, passing the address
of the device to connect to. Then, you can read a value defined by
either its handle or by its UUID. For example:

```python
from gattlib import GATTRequester

req = GATTRequester("00:11:22:33:44:55")
name = req.read_by_uuid("00002a00-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb")[0]
steps = req.read_by_handle(0x15)[0]
```


Reading data asynchronously
--------------------------

The process is almost the same: you need to create a GATTRequester
passing the address of the device to connect to. Then, create a
GATTResponse object, on which receive the response from your
device. This object will be passed to the `async` method used.

**NOTE**: It is important to maintain the Python process alive, or the
response will never arrive. You can `wait` on that response object, or you
can do other things meanwhile.

The following is an example of response waiting:

```python
from gattlib import GATTRequester, GATTResponse

req = GATTRequester("00:11:22:33:44:55")
response = GATTResponse()

req.read_by_handle_async(0x15, response)
while not response.received():
    time.sleep(0.1)

steps = response.received()[0]
```

And then, an example that inherits from GATTResponse to be notified
when the response arrives:

```python
from gattlib import GATTRequester, GATTResponse

class NotifyYourName(GATTResponse):
    def on_response(self, name):
        print("your name is: {}".format(name))

response = NotifyYourName()
req = GATTRequester("00:11:22:33:44:55")
req.read_by_handle_async(0x15, response)

while True:
    # here, do other interesting things
    sleep(1)
```


Writing data
------------

The process to write data is the same as for read. Create a GATTRequest object,
and use the method `write_by_handle` to send the data. This method will issue a
`write request`. As a note, data must be a bytes object. See the following
example:

```python
from gattlib import GATTRequester

req = GATTRequester("00:11:22:33:44:55")
req.write_by_handle(0x10, bytes([14, 4, 56]))
```

You can also use the `write_cmd()` to send a write command instead. It has the
same parameters as `write_by_handle`: the handler id and a bytes object. As an
example:

```python
from gattlib import GATTRequester

req = GATTRequester("00:11:22:33:44:55")
req.write_cmd(0x001e, bytes([16, 1, 4]))
```


Receiving notifications
-----------------------

To receive notifications from remote device, you need to overwrite the
`on_notification` method of `GATTRequester`. This method is called
each time a notification arrives, and has two params: the handle where
the notification was produced, and a string with the data that came in
the notification event. The following is a brief example:

```python
from gattlib import GATTRequester

class Requester(GATTRequester):
    def on_notification(self, handle, data):
        print("- notification on handle: {}\n".format(handle))
```

You can receive indications as well. Just overwrite the method
`on_indication` of `GATTRequester`.


Troubleshooting
===============

If you encounter any problem, ensure first that your hardware is compatible and
working fine. To check if your adapter supports BLE, you can use:

    sudo hciconfig hci0 lestates

To check if the device that you want to talk to is discoverable, run:

    bluetoothctl scan le

And check if it appears on the results.
